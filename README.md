# Visual Studio 2017 Source + Files

## Short Information
As we already live in 2017 and a lot of people are still using Visual Studio 2003 so I decided to release my "clean" Visual Studio 2017 Source (including database and serverfiles). I suggest using the resource that is included in this release because most of the *.lua files required changes to be compatible with the latest Lua version.

## What do i need to run this?
